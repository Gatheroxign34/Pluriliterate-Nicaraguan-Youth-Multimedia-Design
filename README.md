    <h1> How do we support youth in Latin America with digital access? How do we foster community engagement through multimedia design? </h1>
        <p> These questions are answered in the following study: </p>
        <p> Methods: Qualitative focus group interviews, observations and ethnographic field notes.Critical Discourse Framework for indepth 
            conversation interpretation in Miskitu, Spanish and English. Triangulation of observations, ethnographic field notes and focus interview data.  </p>
        <p> Analysis: Multilingual Multicultural youth can serve as ambassadors of their communities on social media platforms if community stakeholders such as non-profit organizations supply the hardware and software for semi-professional multimedia design projects. These multimedia projects can serve as catalysts for social change if they address local policy makers through the cultural and linguistic lenses of the community. </p>  
        <p> Implications: Designed the first multimedia design course for multilingual multicultural youth in Puerto Cabezas Nicaragua in 2016. 
            Aided youth in building a global and local online community of 1000+ followers. Blended anti-racist and social justice-based pedagogies 
            to create a safe place for youth to showcase their lived experience with domestic violence, discrimination, bullying and STI awareness  
            and prevention. Collaborated with NGOs in Language and Culture Reclamation for the Miskitu and Mayangna Indigenous communities.         
            Supported and facilitated a high school to university to professional pipeline for youth interested in television-based multimedia design. </p> 
        <p> Long-term impact of the study: Created a model for future leaders in the community to advocate for youth voice on topics of social 
            justice and community transformation using the region’s cultural lenses and languages. Laid a strong foundation for future educators to 
            build multilingual STEAM coursework for youth navigating cultural, racial, linguistic, and digital divides.
